https://docs.xfce.org/panel-plugins/xfce4-mpc-plugin

This is a simple Musicpd (http://www.musicpd.org) client plugin for the Xfce panel.
Features :
- next/stop/play/pause/previous buttons
- current volume/status/playing track when mouse passes over the plugin
- decrease/increase volume with mousewheel
- show a simple playlist window upon middle-click, permitting to select a track to play
- toggle random/repeat/stream/outputs in right-click menu
- launch configurable client (gmpc, xterm -e ncmpc,..) through right-click menu
- launch configurable streaming client (ogg123 -q, mplayer -quiet,..) when playing
- configurable tooltip and playlist formats, using a gmpc-like markup :
  - playlist accepts %artist%, %title%, %album% and %track%
  - tooltip accepts the same plus %vol%, %status% and %newline%

To build it, you have two options :
- against libmpd libraries :
Get'em from your OS' repository/ports, or from source
It will be autodetected by pkg-config.
If libmpd is not installed in a standard directory, use --with-libmpd=path_to_libmpd.
- without libmpd, using simple-libmpd :
Since 0.2.0, i implemented a simple interface with mpd, using plain old sockets.
If libmpd is not found, it will be used as a fallback (or if you specify --without-libmpd)

meson setup build && meson compile -C build && su -c meson install -C build

should suffice in most cases.

If it crashes, recompile it with --buildtype=debug, add it to the panel, attach gdb to it
(gdb -p `pgrep -f libmpc` , continue) and report a bug with a complete backtrace.
